/*
 * 2018 Tarpeeksi Hyvae Soft /
 * VCS
 *
 * An interface for non-GUI code to interact with the GUI.
 *
 * In VCS, the GUI doesn't actively monitor the rest of the program, e.g. frame
 * capture, to keep itself updated. Instead, those other parts of the program are
 * expected to inform the GUI of relevant events via this interface, to which the
 * GUI is then expected to react, for instance by updating itself accordingly.
